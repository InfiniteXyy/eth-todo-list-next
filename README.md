## Info
Actually, I don't know what is the best practice for a web3 app. If I did something wrong, please let me know. thankyou.



- Why the jsonrpc keeps requesting forever, after a transaction is done?
- Should I install web3, @truffle/contract with npm? The generated bundle is too big?
- How can I load a contract artifact, without fetch the json file?
- Did I do something wrong with in the TS related stuff?
- The performance seems to be a bit slow, is it improvable?


## Quick Start

1. Clone the repo
2. Download ganache and run it
3. run `pnpm build:contract`
4. run `pnpm dev`
